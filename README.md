# Tradehub (Trade App) (Crypto - Stocks Trade Logger with Average Cost Calculator)
![Cover image](./assets/images/django-tradehub-cover.webp)

## Project Description
A trading app designed for users who want to track the average costs of their assets, such as cryptocurrencies and stocks, through a dashboard with graphical support, and keep a log of their transaction history.

## Features
- **PostgreSQL Database**: PostgreSQL is used throughout the project due to extensive operations on decimal values.
- **Asset Category Variety**: Initially, the project includes two basic asset categories: Crypto and Stocks. However, the structure of the project allows for an increase in the number of asset categories as needed.
- **Various Types and Numbers of Assets**: Users can create as many new assets as they want in the static categories provided (crypto, stocks) and keep transaction logs within these assets.
- **Asset Category Page/Dashboard**: The Asset Category Dashboard lists all assets created by the user in the selected category (e.g., under the Crypto category: Solana, IOTA, etc.).
- **Asset Detail Pages**: The asset detail pages display all transactions related to the user-created asset within a dashboard. Additionally, they show the total number of assets owned, total cost, and average cost based on the total amount held.
- **Asset Detail Dashboard**: Dashboards are created on the asset detail pages based on the user's transaction logs, showing all transactions and average costs.
- **Automatic Average Cost Calculation**: When entering a new asset transaction on an asset detail page, the average cost is calculated based on the total amount and cost for both buy and sell transactions. Users only need to enter the total asset amount and cost for the transaction they are performing.
- **Average Cost Graph**: An average cost graph is created on the asset detail page based on all purchases, showing the costs of transactions visually. This allows users to track whether their costs are increasing or decreasing.
- **Buy & Sell Transactions**: Users can log both buy and sell transactions in the system.
- **Privacy**: Only logged-in users can access their asset transaction activities and asset categories.
- **Rest API**: Restful API support will be added shortly.
